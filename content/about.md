I'm Ivan Antipov, machine learning engineer, data scientist and physicist.

### :man_student: Education
- PhD in Physics, Volgograd State University (now)
- M.Sc. in Physics, Volgograd State University (2023)
- B.Sc. in Physics, Volgograd State University and Eurasian National University (2021)

During my studies, I was mainly involved in theoretical physics: analytical calculations and computer modelling for various physical systems, from the quantum dynamics of molecules to the search for the conditions for the existence of vacuum in the universe.

My main research focused on the development of a physical model describing the effect of symmetry breaking by electron transfer in excited symmetric molecules. The developed model allows to understand and describe the dynamics of quantum systems in photovoltaic devices (e.g. solar cells).
